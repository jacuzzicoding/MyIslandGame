## About

MyIslandGame combines resource management with deep ecosystem simulation. Your actions have real consequences on the environment and its inhabitants.

### Key Features (Planned)
- **Living Ecosystem**: Animals and plants form a complex food web with interdependent species
- **Entity Evolution**: Creatures evolve over generations, adapting to your actions and the environment
- **Resource Extraction**: Everything you craft comes from the world with visible environmental impact
- **Survival Elements**: Navigate day/night cycles, weather, and hunger systems
- **Procedural Generation**: Explore unique islands with their own resources and challenges

## Current State

The game is in early development (v0.0.2-alpha). Current features include:
- Entity Component System architecture
- Basic movement and collision detection
- Simple rendering of placeholder graphics
- Input management system
- Game state management
- Camera system with zoom and player following
- Tile-based procedural map generation
- Day/night cycle with visual effects
- Simple UI framework and debug display

See the [RELEASE_NOTES.md](RELEASE_NOTES.md) for detailed information about the current version.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- [.NET 8.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) or newer
- [MonoGame](https://www.monogame.net/)

### Installation and Running
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/jacuzzicoding/MyIslandGame.git
cd MyIslandGame

# Install dependencies (Mac users)
# Mac users may need to install freetype6 library
